      /* Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.*/

      const str =
        "No offense but,\nYour writing is among the worst I've ever read"
      const str2 = "N ffns bt,\nYr wrtng s mng th wrst 'v vr rd"
      console.log('original:', str)
      console.log('requierd:', str2)
      console.log(
        'result:',
        str
          .split(' ')
          .map((word) => word.replace(/[iaeou]/gi, ''))
          .join(' ')
      )
