the main difficulty eas to understand the syntax compering to other js use cases, their is no need to separate with "," b/w values you wish to replace.
/[regex]/- everything you put inside [] will be replaced
the flags at the and that i used were /gi
g- for global or all cases
i- for case insensitive lowercase and uppercase alike.
